d2cdb is a tool for building cdbs from file-system hierarchies.

usage: d2cdb [-tm] cdb cdbtmp dir [[dir]...]

    d2cdb takes n directories and recursively maps the file contents of the
    directory into a cdb keyed on the relative path to the file (from root
    path/to/dir).

    d2cdb attempts to use the cdbmake program (http://cr.yp.to/cdb/cdbmake.html)
    passing argv1 and argv2 unless the -t option is specified, in which case
    it uses tinycdb's 'cdb' program (http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html) with
    the -c option, passing argv2 to cdb's -t (tmp) option and argv1 as argv1.

    When the -m option is passed, d2cdb will recursively map the file contents
    of the directory into a cdb keyed on the relative leaf-directory path, using
    the filename to order the leaf-directory key.

Install:

    ./installer -p <prefix>

    Will install d2cdb in <prefix>/bin (prefix defaults to /usr/local/).

Exit Codes:
      0) success
    100) improper usage
    111) temporary failure (typically no cdbmake/cdb, or argv3...n is not a dir)

Dependencies:
    + Bourne Shell (/bin/sh)
    + cdbmake or cdb
