d2cdb is a tool for building cdbs from file system hierarchies.

usage: d2cdb [-amorth] cdb_file tmp_file directory [directory ...]

    a : include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.')
    m : remove the file name from the cdb key
    o : replace earlier cdb entries if the keys are identical
    r : reverse the directory traversal order (implies `-o')
    t : unused option for compatibility
    h : show the help

    d2cdb takes n directories and recursively maps the file contents of each
    directory into a cdb keyed on the relative path to the file (from the root
    path/to/dir).

    If the -m option is given, d2cdb will recursively map the file contents of
    the directory into a cdb keyed on the relative leaf directory path, using
    the filename to order the leaf directory key.

    If the -o option is given, d2cdb will override/replace earlier cdb entires
    with later cdb entries if the keys are identical.

Build:
    A makefile is provided in the `src' directory which will build with the
    following options:

        gcc d2cdb.c -o d2cdb -Wall -O2 -std=c99 -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lcdb -g

    To enable debug output, append `-DDEBUG' when building with gcc or use:

        make CFLAGS="-g -DDEBUG"

Install:
    Moving the `d2cdb' binary to a directory in PATH suffices. One can also use
    the installer provided, for example:

        sudo ./installer -o root -g wheel # installs in /usr/local/bin

Exit Codes:
      0) success
    100) error
